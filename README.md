# processing-learning

I'm learning about generative design using the [Generative Design book by Hartmut Bohnacker](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Hartmut-Bohnacker/dp/1616890770).  

This repository will contain the exercises as I complete them.  

To run these little programs, you will need to download [Processing 3](https://processing.org/), a free and open source software.
